## Professional Experience

**Research Assistant at Western University (2019-Present)**
- Established a Clustered Federated Learning approach with CNNs to address the challenges of non-IID data in sentiment analysis applications.
- Formulated a Federated Learning model using LSTM and Transformer networks to assess imbalanced dataset impacts on sentiment analysis training.
- Developed a transfer learning method using CNNs and wavelet decomposition for human activity recognition, refining accuracy by re-training for individuals.
- Introduced a personalized CNN-based approach with signal processing for sensor data-driven human activity recognition, enhancing individual-specific accuracy.
- Created CNN and FFNN models using leave-one-subject-out validation for accurate human activity recognition from sensor data for new individuals.


**Software DeveloperSoftware Developer at Algobot (Cryptocurrency software) (Apr-Aug 2022)**
- Developed a scanner for the Cryptocurrency market to filter cryptos with high momentum
- Developed a bot to draw static and dynamic supports and resistances automatically and predicting future prices
- Examined various strategies with backtests and real-time tests to find a good trading strategy

**Data ScientistData Scientist at Xlscout (Sep-Dec 2021)**
- Found U.S. patents‚Äô solutions and related sections in each patent using machine learning techniques.
- Summarized the main idea for the solution of each patent using extractive and abstractive models such as Bert, Pegasus, and so on.

**Senior Data Analyst at Royan Institute (Jan-Jun 2017)**
- Applied different classification methods such as C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, radial basis function neural networks, and feed-forward neural networks to predict do we have to freeze the umbilical cord blood stem cells or not
- Predicted quality of cord blood for newborns using ensemble supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques and saving $1 Million for the Royal Institute using our machine learning approach

**Senior Data Analyst at Sina Bank (Nov 2016 - Feb 2017)**
- Extracted strong and frequent rules between the bank‚Äôs web services to improve the recommender system in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) section
- Used data mining techniques, in particular, association rules to create and improve the recommendations for the banking industry

**Data Analyst at Traffic Department of Mazandaran Province (Jul 2016 - Nov 2016)**
